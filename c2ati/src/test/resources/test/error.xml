<!-- 
Known error types:
MISSINGORINCORRECTPARAMS – Only sent during login, if your client sends an invalid protocol version,
client type, or host id.
INCORRECTEMAILPW – Sent during login, if Collective2 email and password are unknown or do not
match.
OLDCLIENT – This client/protocol version are no longer supported. The URL field will be filled in with a
page where new software can be downloaded or an explanation can be issued. If you want to force this error
message when an “old” version of your software checks in, please let Collective2 know which build numbers
you want to trigger this flag.
NOSUBSCRIPTIONS – The C2 customer (identified by the email and password during login) has no valid
subscriptions to trading systems, and thus will not receive any signals. The URL field will be filled in with a
URL that takes the customer to a page where he can sign up for trading systems with free trial periods.
SESSION TIMED OUT – Your client did not contact the server for over 20 minutes. The session id is now
invalid. You must re-login and request a new session id.

NEEDAGMT – Before an end-user can use the C2 AutoTrading platform, he is required to read and
electronically sign an Agreement in which he acknowledges the risks of AutoTrading. No trades will be sent
until this agreement is signed. When you receive a NEEDAGMT message, you will also be given a <url>.
You should open a browser window and go to that URL. There, the customer will be able to read and (if he
chooses) sign the agreement. In the meantime, you can continue polling C2, and will continue receiving the
NEEDAGMT message. As soon as the customer signs the agreement, this error message will no longer be
sent.
